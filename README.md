# GenAI-Chat-Messenger
This Mission aims to create an interactive and user-friendly frontend chat application. The primary feature is the chat interface where users can converse with ReX, an LLM-powered chatbot. For AI, this chat will be connected to OpenAI's GPT3.5 API. The application will also include an Activity dashboard to track user engagement and progress.
